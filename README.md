This program takes a userInputted response in the URL and then the terminal displays if the numbers inputted are even or odd.

Peer reviewed by Amardeep Mann: Code works greats for integers both positive and negative! Code is clear and concise- good use of modulo and if/else. We didn't really learn about how to deal with edge cases for API's but if I throw in a string or decimal into the URL it throws an error. You could use a TryParse in a future revision to maybe let the user know they can only enter integers. But I'm sure we'll cover a more elegant solution in class soon. Great work!
